Time for some Netflix and ERD. You are going to design the database for GA's new streaming service. In case you have been living in a cave, netflix is a streaming entertainment service company, which provides subscription service streaming movies and television episodes over the Internet 

Here's what you need to do:

* Draw the ERD (you can use tools like https://www.draw.io/ or https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
* Create the SQL for tables and columns
* Write SQL queries to get information

### Deliverables

Allow user to see all movies and TV shows

Show the user different categories of those movies and TV shows

Allow a user to add things to their favourites 

Show a user their recently watched/currently watching

### Further
Allow an account to have multiple users - this could be done by having different tiers of accounts

### Further
Recommend users movies and shows based on previously watched
